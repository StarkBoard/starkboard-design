The "Pool Page" is a section that enables our users to monitor all metrics associated with Pools and Yields. These metrics can be sorted into various categories, such as the highest APY, the TVL, and a link that directs to the pool's website. 

It took us approximately 3 hours to set the up the user experience / interface of this page.
