# starkboard-design
The implementation of UI/UX design for the Starkboard web app was a crucial step in the development process. 
Our goal was to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface that would enhance the user experience and make it easy for users to navigate and interact with the app.

To achieve this, we worked closely with our design team to create wireframes and prototypes, and conducted user testing to gather feedback and make any necessary revisions. The result is a sleek and functional design that is sure to improve the overall user experience of the Starkboard web app.
